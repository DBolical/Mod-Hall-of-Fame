# Mod-Hall-of-Fame

Welcome to the Mod Hall of Fame, a celebration of the best video game modifications ever made over the past 25 years. Every mod on this list has earned its spot be it via commercial or critical acclaim and has influenced gaming in some way. Over 50,000 mods have been released so whilst we cannot list them all, we attempted to pick the standout mods spanning various genres and games. Each year we shall add new and old mods to this list (ordered by first release date).
